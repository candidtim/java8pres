This repository contains source code used for a beginner-level workshop on Java 8. It introduces a sample application
implemented in Java 7 and series of refactorings with Java 8 language features. The application under the question is
inspired by a [Reverse Polish notation calculator](http://learnyouahaskell.com/functionally-solving-problems#reverse-polish-notation-calculator)
problem from [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) book.
